In this article, we will review some of the chapters from each section of Hematology/Oncology Secrets and highlight some of the key points and "secrets" that they contain. We will also provide some references for further reading and learning.
 
## General Concepts
 
This section covers the general principles and concepts that are essential for understanding hematology and oncology. It includes chapters on evaluation of common clinical scenarios, such as palpable breast mass, lung mass, testicular mass, intracranial mass, anemia, bleeding diathesis, adenopathy, leukocytosis, and more. It also covers topics such as carcinogenesis, cancer in the elderly, prevention and management of common toxicities, infectious complications of chemotherapy, biologic therapy of cancer, therapeutics, paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes, and more.
 
Some of the "secrets" from this section are:
 
- The most common cause of a palpable breast mass in women under 40 years old is fibrocystic disease.
- The most common cause of a lung mass in smokers is bronchogenic carcinoma.
- The most common cause of a testicular mass in young men is germ cell tumor.
- The most common cause of an intracranial mass in adults is metastatic tumor.
- The most common cause of anemia in the United States is iron deficiency.
- The most common cause of bleeding diathesis in adults is acquired factor deficiency.
- The most common cause of adenopathy in adults is reactive lymphadenitis.
- The most common cause of leukocytosis in adults is infection.
- Carcinogenesis is a multistep process that involves initiation, promotion, progression, and metastasis.
- Cancer in the elderly is more prevalent, more heterogeneous, and less responsive to treatment than in younger patients.
- The most common toxicities of chemotherapy are myelosuppression, nausea and vomiting, mucositis, alopecia, and neurotoxicity.
- The most common infectious complications of chemotherapy are bacterial infections (especially gram-negative), fungal infections (especially Candida and Aspergillus), and viral infections (especially herpes simplex and varicella zoster).
- Biologic therapy of cancer involves the use of agents that modulate the immune system or target specific molecules on cancer cells. Examples include monoclonal antibodies, cytokines, vaccines, and gene therapy.
- Therapeutics is the science and art of choosing and using drugs to treat diseases. It involves pharmacokinetics (what the body does to the drug), pharmacodynamics (what the drug does to the body), pharmacogenetics (how genetic factors affect drug response), and pharmacoeconomics (how cost-effectiveness influences drug choice).
- Paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes are rare disorders that result from an immune-mediated response to a tumor antigen that cross-reacts with neural tissue. They can affect any part of the nervous system and can precede or follow the diagnosis of cancer. Examples include Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis, and paraneoplastic opsoclonus-myoclonus.
